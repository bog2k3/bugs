* add instrumentation to find out why CPU stays at 25% (on each core)	
* regarding ^ seems like race condition between FrameCapture::start()/::stop() and ::getResults

	* [FIXED] problems (deadlock/crash) when calling Box2D on multiple threads
		- [DONE] must defer all WRITE calls (createFixture and such) from world update until the end and execute them sequentially
		- [DONE] also joint breakage
		- [FIXED] investigate if query calls may happen simultaneously (with callback mechanism, small chance)
			(using Box2D-MT and stack-local query callback objects)
			-- will probably have to synchronize queries which would screw performance
			-- [DONE] or find another way (MT Box2D perhaps?)
 
	* [FIXED] crash after commit - probably due to some body not having the getAssociatedEntity func ptr set
		- egg & zygote may still be problematic

	* [FIXED] nose & egglayer positions after commit are broken
	* [FIXED] CRASH after joint break: joint Torso(8)::J breaks but no motor lines are removed
	  - [FIXED] downstream bone has no motor lines !!
		- CAUSE: addMotor() is called from Ribosome() before part is added to parent
			BodyPart::addMotorLine() canot propagate up the tree
		- output push from neurons into non-existent motor inputs cause memory corruption
	  - [NOBUG] side bugs:
		- all motor lines are removed from torso at detach()
		- remove_motor_line is called twice for each detachment

	* [FIXED] output nerves to motor inputs linkage broken - neuron 4 is linked to 3 motors (gripper & muscles)
		- binarySearch in VMS is broken !
	* [FIXED] MEMORY CORRUPTION on Ribosome::growBodyPart()::vector::push_back() - double free() or memory corruption. 
		- Debug with valgrind/custom new/delete
		- fixed - was caused by writing at offset [targetSegment] of array, which came from genes, unsanitized :-)
	* [FIXED] neurons which don't appear in synapses (thus they don't exist) are added as input/output nerves 
		which causes a crash
* Debug why nerve linkage breaks when mutating; also why most bugs are FUBAR after mutations
