* CRASH after joint break: joint Torso(8)::J breaks but no motor lines are removed
	- downstream bone has no motor lines !!
	- CAUSE: addMotor() is called from Ribosome() before part is added to parent
		BodyPart::addMotorLine() canot propagate up the tree
	- output push from neurons into non-existent motor inputs cause memory corruption

* output nerves to motor inputs linkage broken - neuron 4 is linked to 3 motors (gripper & muscles)
