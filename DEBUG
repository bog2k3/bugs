	* [FIXED] CRASH after joint break: joint Torso(8)::J breaks but no motor lines are removed
	  - [FIXED] downstream bone has no motor lines !!
		- CAUSE: addMotor() is called from Ribosome() before part is added to parent
			BodyPart::addMotorLine() canot propagate up the tree
		- output push from neurons into non-existent motor inputs cause memory corruption
	  - [NOBUG] side bugs:
		- all motor lines are removed from torso at detach()
		- remove_motor_line is called twice for each detachment

	* [FIXED] output nerves to motor inputs linkage broken - neuron 4 is linked to 3 motors (gripper & muscles)
		- binarySearch in VMS is broken !
	* [FIXED] MEMORY CORRUPTION on Ribosome::growBodyPart()::vector::push_back() - double free() or memory corruption. 
		- Debug with valgrind/custom new/delete
		- fixed - was caused by writing at offset [targetSegment] of array, which came from genes, unsanitized :-)
