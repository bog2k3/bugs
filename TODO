* !!! create DebugDraw class to overlay labels over Entities - use to debug nose signal values
		* parts with no fixtures (noses) are not drawn correctly after commit
		* !!! fix problem with nose triangle being too small -> causes Box2D to crash
* !!! prevent b2d crashing from too small polygons which may be caused by degenerated body parts
	- maybe don't create fixtures for them?
		* multiple outputs from nose (sense different types of entities)
		* need FAST method to get nearest body of certain type (for nose)
		* outputVMS coord genes for sensors (indexed)
* extend VMS to 0..1000 (0..100 is to small compared to mutation values)
* redesign bug with two simple legs, two nose sensors - drive by smell
	- simple neural system, just bias towards the stronger sensor
		* add priority to synapses (float) - inputs will be ordered by highest priority first
			- this will stabilize input #0 for special neurons (gate/modulator): set #0 synapses to priority 100
			- default 0 priority to input nerves so they shouldn't affect the order;
			- default [0.0~10.0] priority for random synapses
* changes in neurons:
			- neuralConst as offset to sum in all neuron types (rename to "bias")
			- new neuralParam to use in special function neurons which now use neuralConst
			- new abs() neural function
			- figure out how to multiply 2 signals - perhaps a new neural func?
	- memory neuron with a special input (#0) to signal when to write
			- gate neuron with a special input (#0) to signal when to pass through (use bias as thresh)
		* implement slow motion with fixed timestep
* gripperul sa se desprinda la o anumita forta d.p. cu size
* spawnerele de mancare sa faca pauza din cand in cand -> avantaj mooveri
	- variable food chunk size
* heterogenous environment
	- hazards/dangers
	- different types of food spawners
	- add complexity - more objects and stuff
* mouth can only eat stuff smaller than its size
* bugs should be able to eat smaller bugs alive
* fix repopulation (zygot mass)
		* rewrite default bug genome to use segmentation for leg
		* tune nerve signals - GRIPPER must disengage sooner
		* tune joint resillience
* bugs degenerate too quickly and too often. Make them more stable
		- reenabled start marker genes which increased stability
* find a better way to decode the genome rather than offset-based
		* develop a better embrionic development process (protein system done)
		* print population & generations in status update
		* !!! fix autosave (doesn't save any more, wtf?)
* fix world design to favour movers
	- food spawners should pause from time to time to make them go in another place
	- movable food spawners - spawn more food than static ones
* print mutation statistics after meyosis
* !!! add SENSORS
* prevent fixture overlapping after load from file -> results in box2D hang (maybe do an epsilon update on physWorld after each entity is deserialized)
* make multiple worlds on different CPU cores which communicate through portals
		* [obsolete]  !!! have redundancy in neural system to make muscle command harder to break
		* prevent attraction between incompatible gamettes
		* check for double deletion and other memory issues (valgrind)
* GUI [lowprio] - stuff to interact with world
* serialization 
		- save/load to/from bigfile
	- other entity types (gamete, dead bug) - also make bug adults directly
		* !!! INVESTIGATE (fix dev gene reusage neural linking) - may already be fixed
		* make gametes fuse into new zygotes
		* fix basic bug neural routing - now it's fucked up
		* make egglayer grow instead of torso
		* fix scaling after break apart
		* fix joint nan angle
* do some statistical analysis on mutation rates
		* add "skipNext" and "jump" genes [added SKIP gene and maxDepth on growth]
		* [obs] make split work
* add "duplicate" as a gene spawn method (copy existing gene)
	- 50%-50% chance to duplicate or new
		* make eggs attract each other
		* !!! make eggs and zygotes (dead ones as well) as food
		* make dead body parts as food
		* fix basic bug muscle sync
* switch from float to double 
* clean up all TODOs and WARNINGs from code... (right.... this will be here forever)
