* [X] next: Metabolism, eating, growing, fat-burning and replenish, egg-laying
	- [X] eat, grow, fat replenish, egg-growth
	- [X] consume energy
	- [X] fix body-part overlapping after scaling and fixture regeneration
* [X] next2: nerves and neurons
* [/] change synapse linkage - VMS based for each input and output
	- [-] gene for number of neuron inputs - float, integer part is used
	- [-] gene for each input vms coord and output coord - these are based on i/o index
		-- these is how synapses will be created ^ (each input binds to the nearest output; outputs can remain unattached)
	- [-] weight gene per each input - index based
	- [X] remove index-based synapse gene
	- [-] all indexes (for inputs/outputs) are floats and integer part is used
	- [X] no more genes for inputs and outputs
	- [X] synapses are only created by synapse gene with inputVMS, outputVMS, weight and priority attributes
		-- the synapse is created from the nearest neuron/sensor at the inputVMS location to the nearest
			neuron at the outputVMS location
	- [X] motors are not linked by synapses, but by old matching mechanism (since one input socket can only be attached to one output)
	- [X] synapses are created between sensors/neurons and neurons
	- [ ] sensors that have no outputs connected to neurons should die (get deactivated) immediately after decoding for performance
	- [X] synapses should be created in two passes:
		-- first decode all offsetted synapse genes and add pairs of <outputSock*, inputSock*> as keys into a map with
			struct SynapseInfo as value (cumulativeValues for weight, priority)
			-- when the same key exists, just update the values
			-- thus more genes can affect the same synapse
		-- second iterate the map and actually create the synapses - create inputSockets and link them to outputSockets
* [X] new Neuron gene creates a neuron in VMS at specified location
	- [X] neurons are only created by the new Neuron gene and will be housed inside the current cell
	- [X] neuron actual VMS coordinate is affected by the VMS offset of the cell that created it
		-- neuron is instantiated right before cell divides, so its final VMS offset is known
	- [X] the Ribosome holds a map of neural gene keys and set<VMScoord> values. If the same gene is re-read in a child cell
		the gene is reinterpreted only if the actual (offsetted) vms coordinate differs from the one already processed, thus
		avoiding collisions
		-- neural genes are added into this map at the end of the decoding of a cell, before division/specialization
		-- NeuronGenes are processed immediately after adding in the map (if not rejected) and instantiate neurons in the current cell.
		-- neuron attrib and synapse genes are processed at the end of the genome decoding, after all neurons have been instantiated.
	- [X] when a cell splits, neurons from the cell are distributed between its children
		-- odd neurons to left and even neurons to right; these neurons are not further affected by the children cells' VMS offsets
	- [X] all synapses (between neurons, or neuron-motor or sensor-neuron) are expressed in VMS coordinates
		-- thus no more neuron indexes
	- [X] all other neural genes (transfer, bias etc) bind to the nearest neuron from their target VMS location
	- [X] VMS is universal across the entire organism, all cells, neurons, sensors and motors share it, altough individual neurons are associated with individual cells for detachment purposes
		- [X] however VMS coordinates are relative to the current cell's VMS offset. Thus a synapse decoded in a cell will have its 
			real VMS values different then the ones encoded in the gene.
* [ ] Change VMS and synapse mechanism - distributed NS and localized neural gene expression
	- the aim is to have a more robust neural system and allow local alterations based on the layout of the phenotype which have
		a smaller change of breaking the entire system
	- [ ] every body part has a default Neuron created inside in the middle of the VMS, with transfer=ONE and no default synapses
		-- this ensures that the neural graph can be connex
	- [ ] all neural genes are interpreted in their local context (the cell they were read from) 
		-- thus neurons can be created only by genes within the cell; neural properties affect only the neurons within the cell
	- [ ] synapse genes can only link neurons from the cell and its immediate neighbours (those linked by joints)
		-- the VMS lookup is restricted to this local scope
	- [ ] synapse genes coordinates are not affected by VMS offset any more (since the neurons they refer to are already offseted)
		-- thus synapse gene coordinate are used as-is
	- [ ] neural genes are only interpreted when read from a specialized cell; cells that divide will ignore neural genes except VMSOffset
	- [ ] each synapse is guaranteed to be created since there is at least 1 (the default) Neuron in each cell
	- [ ] subgraphs of neurons that are not linked to at least a sensor and a motor should be removed for performance reasons
	- this removes the need to inherit neurons when a cell divides
	- no more need for neural gene maps in the Ribosome, just a set of neural genes in the decode context will suffice
	- [ ] change motor nerve linkage mechanism to only lookup neurons from within the motor cell and its immediate neighbours 

* [X] rethink hyperspace to favour most-usefull possibilities - arrange neighbours in a better way
* [/] !!! Rethink growth mechanism - more fractal/division like in order to favour evolution
	- [X] a small change by itself must be able to benefit the bug - current model is not good at this
	- [X] new cell division based system
		-- [X] cell division working prototype
		-- [X] !! implement new mechanism in Ribosome
	- [X] new division parameter genes: angle, ratio, mirror?, reorientate?, level restrictions
		-- [X] ^ these boolean values are encoded in floats +/-
	- [X] cell divides at an angle but its children keep the same orientation, unless reorientate is specified in the division, in which case the children will be reoriented by this angle
	- [X] proteins accumulate per cell, not per segment - no more segments 
	- [X] if proteins yield x*y*z*w = 0, the cell specializes into default type - fat cell body part
	- [X] proteins should have a float weight instead of current int 1
	- [X] division creates bond between child cells (weld/pivot joint)
	- [/] when dividing, each existing bond is either split or inherited by one side:
		-- [X] if division axis is similar to bond direction (angle error < thresh), bond is split and inherited by each side
		-- [X] otherwise each side inherits bonds on its side of the division axis
		-- [X] new BondBias gene that biases the bond inheritance axis towards one side
		-- [ ] result is a graph of cells - use it to find shortest path to route sensor/motor nerves
	- [X] division automatically creates joint (weld or pivot) between child cells as well as muscles (only for pivot joint)
		-- [X] (pivot only) joint's default (rest) orientation is perpendicular to the division axis, going from left child cell to right child cell; it's angle direction is the same as the parent cell (so joint can be mirrored as well)
		-- [X] left and right muscles are defined with respect to the joint's zero-axis (left muscle on the positive side); mirrored joints have left/right switched 
	- [X] when cell splits, part of its mass must be used for joint and muscles (if pivot joint)
		-- [X] original cell is kept for joint/muscle genes and its size is changed to joint size - it's used on the ctor of PivotJoint
	- [X] new muscle parameter genes with left/right restriction per cell - dictate the parameters of the muscles that will be created by the division (only for pivot joint)
	- [X] if division splits the pivot joint, muscles will be duplicated for each resulting joint (depending on mirroring)
	- [X] new VMS offset gene to control offset for a division branch (mirrored trees with same genes must have different coordinates to enable control by different neurons)
		- [-] handle mirrored tree case
			-- there's no sensible way to achieve this, will just let a vms offset gene with branch restriction do the job
				otherwise the two mirrored subtrees will have the same offset
		- [X] VMS offset is inherited into the child cells but the same gene cannot be applied twice in the same cell
			-- so if a cell's VMS offset is already affected by a gene decoded in the parent cell and the same gene is encountered again
				during child decoding, it will be ignored second time
			-- keep a set of vms offset genes into each cell and pass it down to its children
	- [X] division happens when gene decoding reaches the end, so all genes have a chance of being read
		-- [X] !! because of this, attribute gene handling must be redesigned (body part classes don't have the chance to register the attributes any more before the genes are decoded since the body-part classes are instantiated when decoding is finished for the current cell)
	- [X] each cell specializes into a body part depending on hyperspace position or turns into a FatCell (for unused or incomplete positions)
		-- [X] ^ maps of gene-types/values in BodyCell that accumulates the values
		-- [X] once the decoding is done, the body part type is determined and following actions take place:
		-- [X] a map of body-part-type/static methods is used to call the correct method to update the cell's density
		-- [X] another similar map is used to retrieve the future body part's shape and connection points, and all neighbour link positions are updated so that cells will be in the correct position
		-- [X] the correct body part is now instantiated while the cell's position, size, density and shape are all correct.
		-- [X] BodyPart base class uses the cell to retrieve size, density, position, rotation and velocity for PhysicalBody
		-- [X] derived body part classes use the cell's gene maps to retrieve various specific attributes 
		-- [X] unspecialized cells will instantiate a FatCell body part which acts as an energy storage
	- [X] joints and muscles are not created explicitly any more - remove them from hyperspace
	- [X] must rethink muscle linkange and body part hierarchies
	- [ ] must find different way to route sensor and motor lines through neighbouring cells - no more parent hierarchy
	- [X] BodyParts hold a list of all their neighbours - Joints are treated as part of the graph as well, so the BodyParts will actually hold links to joints, not directly to other BodyParts (with the exception of Muscles which are attached directly to the left-side body part)
		-- in this way the mass of the whole body can be easily computed (Joints have mass too) and the whole thing becomes more uniform
	- [X] (not a problem any more) perpendicular division of two adjacent cell problem - square of cells
	- [X] !!! proteins are NOT inherited !!!
	- [X] default child cell genome offset is 0 - same genes as parent
	- [X] new gene child offset left/right which changes the default offset (relatively) of the child cells once the division takes place
	- [X] each cell knows if it's left or right and if it's mirrored
	- [X] new restrictions on genes for left/right
	- [X] all unused positions in hyperspace should be filled up with FatCell
	- [X] no more start marker genes in order to allow for easy variation in offsets
	- [ ] if decoding starts on a STOP gene, it moves forward until the 1st valid gene
	- [X] body attribute genes are read at any depth but only interpreted once - see below
	- [ ] when a joint between cells breaks, all synapses, motor lines and sensor lines passing through it are disconnected
		-- [X] also if some of the cells become isolated from energy sources they die
			-- body parts die when isolated from mouth or egg-layer
		-- [X] after a split, each of the two parts may live on if they have energy
			-- and if they both have mouths and egg-layers
		-- [X] must introduce a default energy drain for each cell regardless if they do work or not, so that parts that are isolated from a mouth will eventually die
	- [X] !!! No more need for a Torso, it'll just be an unspecialized cell (or bone)
	- [ ] tune muscle actuation: max contraction speed + limited range of motion 

* [ ] !!! New gene mutation method: Flip-Sign (with much lower probability) -> will avoid boolean float genes becoming too stable by being too far away from zero
* [X] Mouth also function as food processing facility, taking over this function from Torso
* [X] FatCells have an energy buffer proportional to their size, apart from the fat mass
	- [X] when energy is used in the body, it is subtracted from this buffer
	- [X] when food is processed by mouth, first thing to fill up is the energy buffer, then the excess goes into fat mass
	- [X] if the energy buffer is depleted, fat mass will be used to fill it up
* [X] when energy is required, it will be subtracted uniformly from all existing fat cells, as much as possible, to keep them balanced.

* [ ] World must also be serializable and save the general world properties (extents and other things)
	- [ ] create spatial cache (call setExtents) also when loading
* [ ] parameterized loading of World - when merging a session should omit walls & adjust extents & existing walls to union
* [X] !!! optimize World::getEntitiesInBox(), it takes 95% of Nose::update() which takes 90% of all entities update
	- [X] partition the world in a matrix and cache entities in each cell; query cells overlaping the box requested
	- [X] cache only for the duration of the frame, so for each cell at most 1 call will be made per frame
* [ ] must test aabb.intersect() and spatial cache
* [X] write a proper build config (make or cmake) - don't rely on eclipse any more
	- migrated to CMake
* [X] Logger must be thread-safe!
* [ ] velocity & angular velocity sensors
* [ ] eyes
* [ ] orientation sensor (compass)

* [X] synchronize grippers better (earlier)
* [X] split update list to each core to run faster
* [X] fix MAX neural structure processing nose outputs - replace thresh neurons with gates

* [X] !!! fix problem with nose triangle being too small -> causes Box2D to crash
* [X] !!! prevent b2d crashing from too small polygons which may be caused by degenerated body parts
	- [-] maybe don't create fixtures for them?
	- [X] very small fixtures are scaled up to avoid this
* [X] multiple outputs from nose (sense different types of entities)
* [X] need FAST method to get nearest body of certain type (for nose)
* [X] outputVMS coord genes for sensors (indexed)
* [X] extend VMS to 0..1000 (0..100 is to small compared to mutation values)
* [X] redesign bug with two simple legs, two nose sensors - drive by smell
	- [X] simple neural system, just bias towards the stronger sensor
* [X] add priority to synapses (float) - inputs will be ordered by highest priority first
	- [X] this will stabilize input #0 for special neurons (gate/modulator): set #0 synapses to priority 100
	- [X] default 0 priority to input nerves so they shouldn't affect the order;
	- [X] default [0.0~10.0] priority for random synapses
* [/] changes in neurons:
	- [X] neuralConst as offset to sum in all neuron types (rename to "bias")
	- [X] new neuralParam to use in special function neurons which now use neuralConst
	- [X] new abs() neural function
	- [X] figure out how to multiply 2 signals - perhaps a new neural func?
	- [ ] memory neuron with a special input (#0) to signal when to write
	- [X] gate neuron with a special input (#0) to signal when to pass through (use bias as thresh)
* [X] implement slow motion with fixed timestep

* [ ] spawnerele de mancare sa faca pauza din cand in cand -> avantaj mooveri
	- [ ] variable food chunk size
* [ ] heterogenous environment
	- [ ] hazards/dangers
	- [ ] different types of food spawners
	- [ ] add complexity - more objects and stuff
* [ ] mouth can only eat stuff smaller than its size
* [ ] bugs should be able to eat smaller bugs alive
* [ ] !!! fix repopulation (zygot mass) !!!
* [X] rewrite default bug genome to use segmentation for leg
* [X] tune nerve signals - GRIPPER must disengage sooner
* [X] tune joint resillience
* [-] bugs degenerate too quickly and too often. Make them more stable
	- [X] reenabled start marker genes which increased stability
	- hopefully will be fixed by new division mechanism
* [ ] find a better way to decode the genome rather than offset-based
* [X] develop a better embrionic development process (protein system done)
    - also division based system improves a lot
* [X] print population & generations in status update
* [X] !!! fix autosave (doesn't save any more, wtf?)
* [ ] fix world design to favour movers
	- [ ] food spawners should pause from time to time to make them go in another place
	- [ ] movable food spawners - spawn more food than static ones
* [X] print mutation statistics after meyosis
* [X] !!! add SENSORS
* [ ] prevent fixture overlapping after load from file -> results in box2D hang (maybe do an epsilon update on physWorld after each entity is deserialized)
* [ ] make multiple worlds on different machines which communicate through portals via network TCP
* [X] [obsolete]  !!! have redundancy in neural system to make muscle command harder to break
* [X] prevent attraction between incompatible gamettes

* [ ] GUI [lowprio] - stuff to interact with world
* [ ] serialization 
	- [X] save/load to/from bigfile
